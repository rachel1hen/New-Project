You may need to modify the `extract_data` function to suit your specific requirements.\n* The script saves the data to a CSV file. You can modify the `save_data` function to save the data to a different format (e.g., JSON, Excel).\n* Web scraping may be subject to the terms and conditions of the website being scraped. Always check the website's `robots.txt` file and terms of service before scraping.",

The code imports the OpenCV library (`cv2`).\n2. It defines a `display_image` function that takes the path to the image file as an argument.\n3. Inside the function, it attempts to read the image using `cv2.imread`.\n4. If the image is loaded correctly, it displays the image using `cv2.imshow`.\n5. The code waits for a key press using `cv2.waitKey(0)` and then closes all OpenCV windows using `cv2.destroyAllWindows`.\n6. In the example usage, the code prompts the user to enter the path to the image file and then calls the `display_image` function.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* Make sure to install OpenCV using `pip install opencv-python` before running this code.\n* Replace the `image_path` variable with the actual path to your image file.\n* This code assumes that the image file is in a format that OpenCV can read (e.g., JPEG, PNG, etc.).",

Run the code by executing `python image_viewer.py` in your terminal/command prompt.\n4. A file dialog will appear, prompting you to select an image file.\n5. Select an image file and click \"Open\".\n6. The image will be displayed using matplotlib.\n\n**Note**: This code uses matplotlib to display the image. If you prefer to use PIL, you can uncomment the PIL-related code and comment out the matplotlib code.
